"""A group has no info section, so nothing asks for one.

FROM THE OPERATOR'S LOG (2026-09-24), three times around a single group panel:

    ERROR - Error loading info for group:Icaruse: Invalid container name:
            'group:Icaruse'

Nothing breaks. `get_container_info` rejects the name, the caller reads the
failure as "no info configured" and returns the embed unchanged, which is the
right outcome. But it is written to the log at ERROR, and a log that reports an
error for a thing working exactly as designed is a log nobody reads twice - the
next real error arrives among them.

A CONTAINER'S INFO IS A CONTAINER'S. It lives in config/containers/<name>.json,
a group has no such file and is never meant to have one, and the info button is
already not drawn for a group (cogs/control_ui.py). The remaining caller is the
status embed enrichment, which is handed whatever the panel is showing.

So it asks the same question the rest of the group work asks - is this target a
group - and stops, instead of finding out by having a service refuse the name.

HOW THIS TEST CAN FAIL: a caller handing a group target to the info service.

COUNTER-CHECK (2026-09-24): red before - the enrichment called the service and
the service logged the refusal.
