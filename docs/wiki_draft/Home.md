# Welcome to the DockerDiscordControl Wiki

**DockerDiscordControl (DDC)** is a powerful Discord bot and Web UI that allows you to monitor and control your Docker containers directly from Discord. It gamifies the experience with an evolving "Mech" system that reacts to community support.

## Key Features

*   **Docker Control via Discord**: Start, stop, and restart containers using simple buttons or commands.
*   **Real-time Status**: Get live updates on container status with visual indicators.
*   **Web Dashboard**: A comprehensive web interface for advanced management, logs, and configuration.
*   **Mech Evolution System**: A unique gamification layer where a virtual Mech evolves based on donations and community interaction.
    *   **Dynamic Speed**: The Mech's animation speed changes based on its "Power" level.
    *   **Visual Progression**: Watch the Mech grow from a scrappy Level 1 robot to a divine Level 11 entity.
*   **Security First**: Role-based access control, spam protection, and secure authentication.
