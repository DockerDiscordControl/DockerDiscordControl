# Response to Unraid Web UI Connection Issue

Thank you for reporting this issue. I understand you're unable to access the Web UI at port 8374 on your Unraid system.

## Root Cause
The DDC container runs the Web UI internally on port **9374**, but it should be mapped to port **8374** externally for user access. It seems the port mapping wasn't applied correctly during installation.

## Solution

### Option 1: Check and Fix Port Mapping in Unraid
1. Go to your Unraid Web UI â†’ Docker tab
2. Click on the DockerDiscordControl container
3. Click "Edit" 
4. Look for the "WebUI Port" setting
5. Ensure it shows:
   - **Host Port:** 8374
   - **Container Port:** 9374
6. Click "Apply" to save changes

### Option 2: Remove and Re-install
If the port mapping is incorrect or missing:
1. Stop and remove the current DDC container
2. Re-install from Community Apps
3. During installation, verify the port mapping shows `8374:9374`

### Option 3: Manual Docker Run Command
If the above doesn't work, you can manually run the container with:
```
docker run -d \
  --name DockerDiscordControl \
  -p 8374:9374 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /mnt/user/appdata/dockerdiscordcontrol/config:/app/config \
  -v /mnt/user/appdata/dockerdiscordcontrol/logs:/app/logs \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  dockerdiscordcontrol/dockerdiscordcontrol:latest
```

## Verification
After applying the fix, test the connection:
```
# From Unraid console
curl -I http://localhost:8374

# Should return:
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Authentication Required"
Server: gunicorn
```

This 401 response is expected because DDC uses HTTP Basic Authentication. When you access the Web UI in a browser, you'll see a login popup asking for username/password (default: admin/admin).

## Additional Notes
- The container must map external port 8374 to internal port 9374
- The Web UI service (gunicorn) listens on port 9374 inside the container
- If port 8374 is already in use on your system, you can use any other free port (e.g., 8375) as the host port

## Automatic Diagnostics (v1.1.3c+)

If you're using DDC v1.1.3c or later, the container includes automatic port diagnostics:

1. **Check container logs** for the Port Diagnostics section:
   ```
   docker logs DockerDiscordControl | grep -A 20 "=== DDC Port Diagnostics ==="
   ```

2. **Via Web UI** (if accessible): Visit `http://[IP]:8374/port_diagnostics`

The diagnostics will automatically detect Unraid and provide specific solutions for your platform.
